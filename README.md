With the technique of face reidentification, it can compare the face feature of rule breaker with the stored face features in the database and identify who the rule breaker is. 
With the technique of image enhancement like denoising, illumination improvement and super resolution. 
This system can be applied to more extreme scenario such as dark environment, equipped with low end camera, etc.
